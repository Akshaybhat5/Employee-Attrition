There are very few people who begin and end their careers in one company. Most people move on after a time, or the company forces them to move on with an involuntary termination. People leaving organizations seems like a quite straightforward matter, but there is a lot to unpack with employee attrition.

Based on the dataset the model can potentially predict the attrition of the employee.

Thank you!!!
